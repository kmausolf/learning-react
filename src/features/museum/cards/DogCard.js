/*
 * Welcome to the DogCard, a reusable component!  In this card, we'll present the info
 * we have on each dog in our museum.  Info on each dog will come into this component
 * as props.  The reason we want this to be its own component is because we want each
 * dog card to have its own state!  Visitors to our lovely museum should be able to
 * click a favorite icon on the card to indicate that they really like this dog.  Since
 * this preference isn't being saved anywhere, it'll be lost upon refresh, but you can
 * use LocalStorage if you would like to save it as an extra challenge *wink wink*.
 * 
 * Included with this project is a basic design of what the card should look like. 
 * Feel free to make it your own and style it how you like!
 * 
 * This file's learning goals:
 * - State management
 * - Hooks
 * - Click handlers
 * - Fallback values
 * - Passing props
 * - CSS styling
 * 
 * Props:
 * dog - This prop contains one dog object with the properties id, name, and image
 *
